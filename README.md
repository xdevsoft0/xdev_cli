# Xdev CLI ðŸš€

**XDev CLI** is a developer-friendly command-line tool to streamline Flutter project development. Quickly scaffold projects, views, and services with built-in support for **Provider** state management and routing.

## Features
- Scaffold a new Flutter project with **Provider**, **routing**, and **assets** setup.
- Automatically generate new **views** with Provider and routing integration.
- Generate reusable **service classes** inside `core/services`.

---

## Installation

1. Make sure you have **Dart SDK** installed. You can check by running:

```bash
dart --version
````

2. Install XDev CLI globally:

```bash
dart pub global activate xdev_cli
```

3. Make sure Dartâ€™s global executables are in your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Create a New Flutter Project

Create a new Flutter project with Provider, routing, and assets set up:

```bash
xdev create project my_app
```

### 2. Navigate to Your Project

```bash
cd my_app
```

### 3. Create a New View

Generate a new view with its corresponding Provider/ViewModel and routing entry:

```bash
xdev create view dashboard
```

This will create:

```
lib/views/dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard_view.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard_view_model.dart
```

And automatically register the route in `lib/routes.dart`.

### 4. Create a New Service

Generate a reusable service class inside `core/services`:

```bash
xdev create service api
```

This will create:

```
lib/core/services/api_service.dart
```

## Example Project Structure

After generating a project and a few views/services, your structure may look like this:

```
my_app/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ api_service.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ views/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dashboard/
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard_view.dart
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ dashboard_view_model.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ routes.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ pubspec.yaml
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```
